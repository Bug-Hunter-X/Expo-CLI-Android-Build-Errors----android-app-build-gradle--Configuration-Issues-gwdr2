The solution often involves carefully reviewing the `android/app/build.gradle` file to identify and resolve the dependency issues. Here's a sample showing a possible fix for a version conflict:

**Problematic `build.gradle` (build.gradle):**
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.example:library-a:1.0")
    implementation("com.example:library-b:2.0") // This might conflict with library-a
}
```

**Corrected `build.gradle` (build.gradle.solution):**
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.example:library-a:1.0")
    implementation("com.example:library-b:1.0") // Updated to compatible version
}
```

In this example, a version conflict between `library-a` and `library-b` is resolved by changing the version of `library-b`.  The actual fix will vary depending on the error message and the specific dependencies involved. Always ensure your dependencies are compatible and up to date.  Refer to the documentation of the relevant libraries to find compatible version combinations.
