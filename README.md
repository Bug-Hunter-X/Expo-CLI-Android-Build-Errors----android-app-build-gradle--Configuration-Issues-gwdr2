# Expo CLI Android Build Errors: `android/app/build.gradle` Configuration Issues

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android projects using the Expo CLI.  The issue often stems from problems within the `android/app/build.gradle` file, resulting in build failures.  The error messages are not always consistent, but they usually point to missing or conflicting dependencies.

This repository contains two files:

*   `build.gradle`: This file showcases a problematic configuration that leads to the build error.
*   `build.gradle.solution`: This file demonstrates the corrected configuration that resolves the build error.

**Steps to Reproduce the Error:**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the `android` directory.
3.  Attempt to build the project using the Expo CLI (e.g., `expo build:android`).

**Solution:**

Refer to the `build.gradle.solution` file for the corrected configuration.  The key is to identify and correct issues within your dependencies, such as version conflicts or missing libraries.
